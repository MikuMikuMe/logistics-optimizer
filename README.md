# logistics-optimizer

Creating a comprehensive logistics optimizer tool involves a significant amount of complexity, especially when integrating AI-driven route planning and demand forecasting. Below, I provide a simplified version of such a program, which includes foundational elements to get you started. This version will focus on basic route optimization using a greedy algorithm approach and demand forecasting using a basic linear regression model from scikit-learn.

For a full-fledged application, you would likely need to integrate more advanced algorithms and real-time data handling, potentially leveraging libraries and services like Google OR-tools for route optimization, and more sophisticated machine learning techniques for demand forecasting.

Here's a basic Python program outline:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from itertools import permutations

# A basic function to simulate demand forecasting using linear regression
def forecast_demand(historical_data):
    """
    Forecast future demand based on historical data using linear regression.
    
    Parameters:
    historical_data (ndarray): Historical demand data for training.
    
    Returns:
    float: Predicted future demand.
    """
    try:
        X = np.arange(len(historical_data)).reshape(-1, 1)
        y = historical_data
        
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X, y)
        
        future = np.array([[len(historical_data)]])
        forecast = model.predict(future)
        return forecast[0]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in demand forecasting: {e}")

# A dummy function for distance calculation (for simplicity, using Euclidean distance)
def calculate_distance(point1, point2):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((point1 - point2) ** 2))

# A basic greedy algorithm for route optimization
def optimize_route(locations):
    """
    Optimize route for a series of locations using a greedy approach.
    
    Parameters:
    locations (list of tuple): List of coordinates representing locations.
    
    Returns:
    list of tuple: Optimized order of locations.
    """
    try:
        if not locations:
            raise ValueError("No locations provided for optimization.")

        start = locations[0]
        route = [start]
        remaining = locations[1:]

        while remaining:
            last = route[-1]
            next_loc = min(remaining, key=lambda loc: calculate_distance(np.array(last), np.array(loc)))
            route.append(next_loc)
            remaining.remove(next_loc)
        
        return route
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in route optimization: {e}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simulate historical demand data
    historical_demand = np.array([100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400])
    
    # Forecast future demand
    future_demand = forecast_demand(historical_demand)
    print(f"Predicted future demand: {future_demand}")
    
    # Locations as coordinates (for simplicity)
    locations = [
        (0, 0),  # Starting point
        (2, 3),
        (5, 8),
        (6, 9),
        (8, 3)
    ]
    
    # Optimize route
    optimized_route = optimize_route(locations)
    print("Optimized route:", optimized_route)
```

### Program Explanation:

1. **Demand Forecasting:**
   - Uses a linear regression model from `scikit-learn` to predict future demand based on historical data.
   - Assumes a simple linear relationship for demonstration purposes.

2. **Route Optimization:**
   - Uses a greedy algorithm approach for route optimization. This is not the most efficient method for complex cases but serves as a simple illustration.
   - Calculates distances using Euclidean distance, assuming locations are represented in a 2D space.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Both demand forecasting and route optimization functions include basic error handling using try-except blocks.

### Considerations for a Full Application:

- Use more sophisticated optimization algorithms, such as the Travelling Salesman Problem solutions or Google OR-Tools.
- Integrate real-time data and manage it using databases or data streams.
- Apply more advanced machine learning models, like ARIMA or LSTM, for demand forecasting.
- Implement a proper user interface or API to interact with the tool.
- Include unit tests and logging to enhance reliability and maintainability.
